# Gateway Project - Web Repository

![gateway-twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Gateway_DAO?style=social)

**Gateway** is the largest professional decentralized networking platform. Leveraging open and collaborative infrastructure, Gateway helps Web3 users to onboard into their favorite communities, build out their decentralized resumes, and begin developing credentials across the ecosystem. Users receive membership NFTs, reward NFTs, and community verified skills and competencies from DAOs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Hasura](https://hasura.io), [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/apollo-client), [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network), and other tools.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn test`

Runs unit tests written for React components. Currently, no testing units are written for the project, although you can write them at any moment following the section about [testing](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `yarn lint`

Lints the written code, so it is compliant with Gateway's ESLint/Prettier configurations.\
This makes the code easier to read, more efficient and organized.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Local environment - instructions to build

*TODO*: documentation on building Dockerized Hasura/PostgreSQL

### 3. run `yarn` and `yarn start`

You need to install all the required packages with `yarn`. It might take some minutes.

After all the packages are installed on your machine, you're ready to execute the local environment. Please use `yarn start` so you can get execute a local version of Gateway's frontend on your machine.

Note: Running `yarn` (esp. the first time) might take a few mins.


### Some considerations

- to outside contributors: always PR your changes with an extensive description on how they're improving the project, as well as a technical description for new functionalities and/or tech stacks.
