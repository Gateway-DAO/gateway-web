            'They commonly offer smart contracts and interfaces to facilitate on-chain actions for decentralized communities.',

        subHeading3:
            'Governance of Grants DAOs was originally conducted through non-transferable shares, meaning participation was largely motivated by social capital over financial returns.',

        subHeading2:
            'Whereas the first chapter of DAOs featured non-transferable shares, Protocol DAOs were the first to issue transferable ERC20 tokens with a secondary market value.',
        subHeading3:
            'These tokens are commonly used to govern protocols, meaning tokenholders have the sole authority to propose, vote on and implement changes to the underlying mechanics of the network.',
        subHeading4:
            'Projects commonly vote on how to distribute tokens, thus opening the doors to liquidity mining, yield farming, fair launches and everything in between.',

        subHeading2:
            'Service DAOs create decentralized working groups for individuals to work for the open internet - essentially acting as crypto-native talent agencies.',
        subHeading3:
            'From legal to creative, governance to marketing, development to treasury management, Service DAOs create funnels to contract web3 mercenaries. Work is often rewarded with ERC20 tokens - providing ownership over the value created for a network.',

            'Where social media turned everybody into a media company, Social DAOs turn every group chat into a digital business.',
        subHeading4:
            'They challenge what it means to be a part of a community and offer ways to lean into becoming a part of a digitally-native tribe.',

            'Media DAOs give that power back to those who consume the content.',
        subHeading3:
            'They break down the way in which writers, streamers, and readers engage with the content they release. Whether it be media mining programs to incentivize contributions or governance over which topics make the front page, Media DAOs turn consumption into a two-way street.',
